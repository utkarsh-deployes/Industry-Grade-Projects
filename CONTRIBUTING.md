Thank you for your interest in contributing to Industry-Grade Projects.

This repository aims to document **hireable, real-world, industry-grade project blueprints** that reflect how software is actually built in professional teams. Maintaining quality and relevance is more important than volume.

## What We Are Looking For

We welcome contributions that:

- Are original and not copied from tutorials or blogs
- Help candidates build projects that genuinely improve hiring outcomes

We value clarity, depth, and realism.

## What We Do Not Accept

Please avoid contributing:
- College-level or tutorial-style projects
- Generic clones (e.g., Netflix, Spotify, basic chat apps)
- Projects without real-world use cases

Submissions that do not meet the quality bar may be declined.
